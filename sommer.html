      <h2>Musicians have become cable specialists...</h2>
      Over the years,
      audio products have become more complex and sound reproduction has improved considerably.
      This doesn‘t make things easier for cable manufacturers.
      Cables are no longer only important for esoteric sound purists and dreamers,
      but also for the manufacturers of instruments, as well as studio and media equipment.
      By now, even the hobbyist is able to recognize improvements in sound quality and
      must no longer rely on second guessing, imagination and subjective judgments.
      <br><br>
      For cable manufacturers like us,
      this represents an important challenge,
      because all of a sudden “technical specs“ have become audible,
      and of course can be verified by the discerning listener and engineer.
      For a company like SOMMERCABLE,
      this is a quite a lucky break, because all of our customers recognise and honour good quality products.
<br><br><br>
      <h2>Is it the cable?</h2>
      Even if the musician, his instrument,
      the loudspeaker and the lighting system are completely perfect and you still have a bad transmission...
       Could it really be that it's your cable? It can!
       <br><br>
       Like many musicians,
       we took our first musical steps in the small home studio or in the village
       combo and were already surprised at the result when we replaced the low budget
       jack plugs on the analog synth with decent metal plugs. Hum away, crack away.
       Or if you replaced the bell wire with a proper guitar cable...
       where do all the crystal clear highs and the "crispe sound" suddenly come from?
